# Gemsmith

## Description
Gemsmith is a game modification for GCFW.

Same as in the previous game, combining a gem with itself is not always the best way to upgrade it. Thanks to the work done at https://github.com/gemforce-team/gemforce, certain recipes - specific orders of duplicating\combining operations - have been discovered that result in a stronger gem than you'd get by U-upgrading, for the same cost. The catch is that it might take upwards of hundreds of operations to perform some of the better recipes.

Gemsmith allows you to skip performing these operations manually, instead it performs the combine on your gem automatically, spending mana accordingly. Unlike wGemCombiner this is done ingame, completely bypassing UI interactions and using no extra inventory slots. 

This is merely a time saving and QOL mod, exactly the same results can be achieved without it, albeit much slower and with more effort. Mana expenditure stats and achievements should be tracked appropriately, [submit an issue](https://github.com/gemforce-team/gemsmith/issues) if you find that something's off!

## Changelog

## Features
* A combine can be performed on a gem anywhere: in your inventory, in towers, lanterns, traps, amplifiers and in the enrage slot.

* The recipes are loaded from a dedicated folder, you can have as many as you need and switch between them with hotkeys. These recipes are defined in a certain format, devised for gemforce, an example recipe is generated on startup. Keep in mind that at the moment only "combine" recipes are supported - upgrading one gem.

* Gemsmith also includes a configuration file that allows you to rebind hotkeys. This includes both Gemsmith's own functions and base game's hotkeys.

* Press Alt + "Perform combine" hotkey to reload your config and recipes.

* Gemsmith keeps a log of the last session, if you see a floating message saying that an error has occured, there might be more information in there. Consult the README included with releases for details.


## Installation
Installation instructions are included in a README in each release.

The modification is installed by applying a diff patch to the game's SWF file.

This is achieved using Courgette: https://blog.chromium.org/2009/07/smaller-is-faster-and-safer-too.html

Courgette repo: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/courgette/+/master


# Recipes
Gemsmith supports two formats of recipes: short and full. An example of short format recipes is generated on first launch in the recipes folder. Example below:
```
o
0+0
1+0
2+0
3+0
4+0
5+1
```
Long format recipes are generated by gemforce. Example below:
```
(val = 1)	 0 = g1 o
(val = 2)	 1 =  0 +  0
(val = 3)	 2 =  1 +  0
(val = 4)	 3 =  2 +  0
(val = 5)	 4 =  3 +  0
(val = 6)	 5 =  4 +  0
(val = 8)	 6 =  5 +  1
```
Recipes for GCFW are a WIP, https://github.com/gemforce-team/gemforce/tree/master/results/leech-combine contains recipes for pure orange gems (the mechanics are the same for those between GCCS and GCFW). Look around the repo for more recipes, but remember that **only combine recipes are supported.** Combine recipes have only one line containing a letter in the beginning of the recipe. If there are more than one lines with letters, like

```
(val = 1)	 0 = g1 b
(val = 1)	 1 = g1 r
(val = 1)	 2 = g1 y
(val = 2)	 3 =  2 +  1
(val = 3)	 4 =  3 +  0
(val = 4)	 5 =  4 +  0
(val = 2)	 6 =  0 +  0
(val = 3)	 7 =  6 +  0
(val = 4)	 8 =  7 +  0
(val = 8)	 9 =  8 +  5
```

, that is not a combine recipe.
You need to copy the equations under "Equations:" from a file in that repo, then paste it into a **separate** .txt file in your recipes folder. Name it however you want, that name will be shown ingame.

Alternatively, you can write your own recipes. Keep in mind that only combines are supported, and Gemsmith expects that the result will be a single gem obtained on the last step.
